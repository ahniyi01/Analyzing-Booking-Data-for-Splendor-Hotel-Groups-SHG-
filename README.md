## Analyzing Booking Data for Splendor Hotel Groups (SHG) with the use of Microsoft Excel

Hello, I stumbled on an interesting dataset on Twitter (well, the owner calls i 'X' now but we still call it twitter here). I decided to play around the dataset to answer some questions the requirements demanded.
